You will write a networked client/server application in Python which allows a client program to query a simple database which is managed by a server program. For this assignment we selected a database of NFL games as an example. The client program sends a message containing the query about a game to the server and the server program responds back with a message containing the requested information. Communications between the client and server must be secured using a hybrid encryption scheme in which asymmetric encryption is used to transmit a session key at the start of a session, and symmetric encryption is used for the remainder of the session.

Operation of the Client/Server
The application is actually two different programs, the client program and the server program. These two programs should both be running as two separate processes which are invoked by the user in a shell. These two programs may be running on the same machine but they may be running on two different machines.

The server must be started before the client. The server will listen to a port until a client initiates communication. Once communication has been initiated, the user will enter a request at the command line of the client, and the client will send that request to the server. The server will send a corresponding response to the client and the client will print the contents of that response on the screen for the user to see. This process will continue until the client sends a quit message to the server. Once the client sends a quit message, the client will quit and the server will wait for another client to initiate communication.
